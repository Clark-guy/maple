      <p>Dear elected officials,</p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Amidst a global pandemic, voters prepared to make their voices heard on
        November 3rd with great determination. The Commonwealth increased voter
        accessibility by allowing vote by mail for any reason, which was{" "}
        <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/11/metro/by-most-accounts-massachusetts-primary-was-historic-success-now-comes-hard-part/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link">
          successful
        </a>{" "}
        and proved that Massachusetts’ infrastructure is capable of handling
        common sense reforms to its election laws. Same Day Registration is one
        such reform. Currently, eligible voters must register at least 20 days
        prior to an election in order to participate. We urge you to support
        legislation that would allow eligible voters in the Commonwealth to
        register to vote on the same day they cast their ballot--either through
        early voting or on Election Day.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Currently,{" "}
        <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx">
          twenty-one states
        </a>{" "}
        plus the District of Columbia allow Same Day Registration in some form.
        In those states, voter turnout has{" "}
        <a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bgrofman/18%20Brians-Grofman-Election%20day%20registration%27s%20effect.pdf">
          increased considerably
        </a>{" "}
        upon enactment. Allowing Same Day Registration will ensure increased
        access to voters who might otherwise not be able to participate in this
        democratic process, owing to work conflicts, health concerns, and other
        barriers. In sum, Same Day Registration would allow more Massachusetts
        voters to make their voices heard, which is crucial for a healthy and
        functioning democracy.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Requiring registration before Election Day discourages so-called “lower
        propensity” voters, or those who aren’t as likely to vote. Without Same
        Day Registration, these voters might miss the opportunity to vote simply
        because they are not aware of the registration deadline. This has the
        effect of disenfranchising those who engage with the election cycle
        closer to Election Day, when interest in politics is at its highest.
        Enacting Same Day Registration allows more people the opportunity to
        vote, no matter when they engage with the political process.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Those who oppose the adoption of Same Day Registration argue that by
        allowing registration to occur at any time up through and including
        election day, there would be insurmountable financial and administrative
        costs. Demos, a non-partisan public policy organization, found in a 2009
        survey ofstates that had already implemented Election Day voter
        registration that{" "}
        <a href="http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/SDR-CostStudy-Final.pdf">
          costs were “minimal”
        </a>
        , and predominantly a reallocation of existing resources to compensate
        for registration at polling places. On the subject of administrative
        costs, the same study also found that implementation of Election Day
        voter registration, particularly on election day, drastically reduces
        the need for provisional ballots and saves the time and expense of
        processing ballots.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Opponents of Same Day Registration also argue that it would increase
        voting fraud. The most recent electoral cycle showed us that while many
        may have fears about fraud, the{" "}
        <a href="https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d">
          incidences of fraud are quite low
        </a>
        . Furthermore, the Same Day registration requirements would parallel
        those for non-Same Day Registration.  Voters registering on election day
        would still be required to provide proof of identity and proof of
        residence, making the process of registration no different from that of
        the current process, with the exception of the deadline.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        The benefits of expanded voter registration far outweigh the potential
        administrative and financial costs. We strongly encourage you to take
        action immediately to bring Massachusetts into a growing group of states
        leading the charge around democracy reform.
