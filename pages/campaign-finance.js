        <b>Why should we have publicly funded campaigns?</b>
        <br />
        In 1998, the voters of Massachusetts
        <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Campaign_Finance_Reform_Initiative,_Question_2_(1998)">
          {" "}
          overwhelmingly{" "}
        </a>
        approved a ballot measure to allow candidates who agreed to spending and
        donation limits access to public funds. But in 2003, the legislature
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/21/us/massachusetts-legislature-repeals-clean-elections-law.html">
          {" "}
          repealed the fair elections law{" "}
        </a>
        as a last-minute amendment to the state budget. Public funding
        provisions exist in the Commonwealth for candidates for statewide
        office, but candidates for state legislature seats have no such support.
        The data on publicly financed elections is
        <a href="https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/FreshStart_PublicFinancingCT_0.pdf">
          {" "}
          clear
        </a>
        . When Connecticut implemented publicly financed elections, legislators
        were able to spend less time fundraising and spend more time with
        constituents. More citizens became donors and educated themselves about
        policy issues. The influence of lobbyists declined, and more bipartisan,
        publicly supported bills were passed. The people of Massachusetts
        deserve responsive representation in the state legislature, and adopting
        public financing would help achieve that goal.
