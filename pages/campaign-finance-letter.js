      <p>Dear Elected Officials,</p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        We write to you today in support of publicly financed campaigns for
        state legislators, and urge you to re-institute a program like those
        described by{" "}
        <a href="https://www.commoncause.org/massachusetts/our-work/reduce-moneys-influence/citizen-funded-elections/">
          Common Cause

        . The Citizens United decision severely restricted the states’ ability
        to regulate campaign finance, leaving these programs as{" "}
        <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/public-campaign-financing-bright-spot-shadow-citizens-united">
          one of the few mechanisms
        </a>{" "}
        available to counteract the distortive effects of money in politics.
        Publicly financed campaigns amplify the voice of small-donors,
        incentivize a{" "}

          more responsive legislature

        and help to{" "}

        .

      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Moreover, Massachusetts voters have unequivocally demonstrated support
        for publicly funded campaigns, including for state legislators.{" "}
        <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Campaign_Finance_Reform_Initiative,_Question_2_(1998)">
          In a 1998 ballot measure
        </a>
        , 58.4% of participating voters backed new laws to implement public
        financing of elections and to establish clear spending limits for
        candidates accessing public funds. The Clean Elections Law was adopted
        the same year and began a program to fund state legislative campaigns.
        It only lasted a few years, as the legislature{" "}
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/21/us/massachusetts-legislature-repeals-clean-elections-law.html">
          repealed the Law
        </a>{" "}
        in 2003 as part of the compromise to pass the state budget. Public
        funding remains available to candidates running for statewide office,
        but notfor those candidates running for the Legislature. However, even
        the current statewide program is{" "}
        <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/06/09/public-financing-mass-governor">
          underfunded
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Under Common Cause’s citizen-funded campaign proposal, candidates who
        meet donor and fundraising benchmarks would receive matching public
        funds for their campaigns. This additional support would incentivize
        closer relationships with constituents, who are best positioned to give
        the required small donations, and would enable more Massachusetts
        residents to run for political office. Candidates receiving public
        funding would be required to participate in at least one debate before
        the primary and at least 2 debates after the primary. These debates will
        allow candidates to share their policy priorities and serve to inform
        voters.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        Research and data from other states indicates a clear correlation
        between publicly funded campaigns and robust, constituent-focused
        representation. When{" "}
        <a href="https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/FreshStart_PublicFinancingCT_0.pdf">
          Connecticut
        </a>{" "}
        implemented publicly financed campaigns, legislators were able to spend
        less time fundraising and spend more time with constituents. Recognizing
        the increased impact of their financial support, citizens educated
        themselves on policy priorities and started donating to campaigns. The
        influence of lobbyists declined, more bipartisan bills were passed, and
        bills passed were more closely aligned with public opinion. Public
        financing also empowered more people to run for office and shifted the
        demographic representation in the Legislature to more closely reflect
        the make-up of the state. In{" "}
        <a href="https://www.commoncause.org/massachusetts/our-work/reduce-moneys-influence/citizen-funded-elections/">
          Arizona
        </a>
        , after public financing was passed in 2000, the state saw a 20%
        increase in the number of voters between the 1996 and 2004 presidential
        elections. The people of Massachusetts deserve to be represented by
        legislators who reflect the people and the policies of the people they
        serve; adopting public financing would help achieve that goal.
      </p>
      <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
        For these reasons, we urge you to consider bills like{" "}
        <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/SD122">SD.122</a>, and
        re-establish public funding for the campaigns of state legislators in
        Massachusetts.
