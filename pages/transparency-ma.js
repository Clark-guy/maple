            There are a multitude of procedural changes that would make the
            Massachusetts electorate more informed and engaged with the
            law-making process. There are a variety of technology changes that
            could be employed on the state's website to achieve a similar end.
            As with most changes, each has benefits and drawbacks. The Good
            Governance Project intends to do a state-by-state comparative study
            on: 1) transparency and accountability rules; and 2) how technology
            is leveraged to inform constituents. We hope to identify best
            practices that balance the practicalities of legislating with the
            democratic imperative of an informed electorate.

            <b>The Issue:</b>
            <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
              Most observers agree that a fundamental component of a successful
              democracy is an informed electorate. Indeed, our state
              constitution explicitly guarantees the exclusive right of
              governance of the people, to the people. State legislators –
              senators or representatives – do just that. They represent
              constituents. Constituents need a mechanism to ensure their
              elected officials are faithfully executing that duty; a way to
              monitor what legislators are doing on their behalf – most
              importantly, how they are voting (or not voting). In Massachusetts
              much of that information
              <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/19/opinion/its-time-lawmakers-support-an-open-house/">
                {" "}
                is kept hidden from the public
              </a>
              . The Good Governance Project believes that providing constituents
              with more information and more opportunities to meaningfully
              interact with our government allows us to better fulfil our civic
              responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
              As law students, we spend countless hours reading judicial
              opinions that say, "I don't like this law – but if constituents
              disagree, they can vote out the legislators who passed it." That
              concept, rational basis review, is a cornerstone of our judicial
              system, and a necessary condition of its viability is an informed
              electorate. The courts often defer to the legislatures, saying,
              "we trust the legislators," but our legislative system often
              appears to say, "we don’t trust our constituents." Consequently,
              the lifeblood of democracy – transparency and accountability – is
              inhibited.

            <b>The Solution:</b>
            <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
              For centuries, the accountability mechanism faced numerous
              technical and cost barriers. How can we quickly provide the
              results of votes? How can we do so in a cost-efficient manner for
              millions of constituents? Those questions are mere relics of
              history. Digital technology – the greatest conduit for information
              distribution in human history – provides this mechanism. The
              ability to access and understand information has never been
              cheaper and the electorate is increasingly capable of finding and
              using such information online.
            </p>
            <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
              Using technology to provide critical information to constituents
              is not only the politically responsible course, but will also
              facilitate more meaningful interactions between constituents and
              legislators, and generally improve the quality of public
              discourse. Technology, for all its benefits, has helped disrupt
              the traditional gatekeeping of information distribution, elevating
              the voices of fame-seekers, bad actors and those solely motivated
              by "clicks" and profit. In this environment, there must be greater
              emphasis on disclosing critical, unquestionable facts – such as
              votes and testimony.

              Massachusetts is an international technology and educational hub.
              We can leverage the state's incredible resources to create a more
              informed electorate, and a more responsive and accountable
              democracy.

          <b>Background:</b>
          <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
            In most states, there are two key circumstances under which
            government must provide information to the public. Otherwise, the
            government itself gets to decide which information to provide, and
            how to provide it. First, almost all states have public records
            legislation, often referred to as Freedom of Information Acts
            (FOIA's). These require elected officials to release certain
            information when it is requested by citizens, the press, businesses,
            and others entities. Massachusetts is one of four states that do not
            subject their legislatures to public records laws, and is the only
            state with such exemptions for its judicial, legislative and
            executive branches.
          </p>
          <p Style="text-indent:1cm">
            Second, the legislature may choose to create rules that mandate the
            publication of its members’ votes. In Massachusetts, the vast
            majority of bills must be approved by two joint committees to become
            law, however the rules do not require joint committees to publish
            their votes – and most, if not all, joint committees do not choose
            to do so. There is a myriad of other potential rules that could help
            inform the electorate on votes, pending bills, amendments, and
            generally provide more opportunity to become informed and
            meaningfully engage with our government.
