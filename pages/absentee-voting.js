        <b>Why do we need No-Excuse Absentee Voting?</b>
        <br />
        Representative democracy is stronger when more constituents participate
        in elections, and turnout is highest when participation is made easy.
        Massachusetts participation rates in the most recent elections indicate
        it was a success â€“ which stems largely from the emergency acts smartly
        passed by the Legislature in response to COVID-19 (see
        <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter115">
          {" "}

        and{" "}

          {" "}
          St.2020 c.255
        </a>
        ). Among the temporary changes made to our election systems was a
        relaxing of vote-by-mail (absentee ballot) restrictions, allowing
        individuals from across the state to vote early and by absentee ballot.

          {" "}
          42% of registered voters in the Commonwealth took advantage of the
          relatively easy means to vote{" "}
        </a>{" "}
        and would likely do so again if given the opportunity. Massachusetts
        should retain these improved voting mechanisms.
