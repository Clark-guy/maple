        <b>Why should we have Same Day Registration?</b>
        <br />
        Currently, MA voters must register twenty days before an election in
        order to participate. Removing this barrier, and allowing eligible
        voters to register up to, and on, election day would allow more
        Massachusetts voters to make their voices heard – a critical aspect of a
        healthy democracy. Currently, twenty-two states allow EDR in some form.
        In those states, voter

        <a href="https://www.demos.org/research/what-same-day-registration-where-it-available">

          found in a 2009 survey{" "}
        </a>{" "}
        that implementing EDR created “minimal” costs, as legislators merely
        reallocated existing resources, and actually reduced the need for
        provisional ballots – saving the time and expense of processing those
        ballots. Voters registering on election day would still be required to
        provide proof of identity and proof of residence, making the process of
        registration no different from that of the current process.You can read
