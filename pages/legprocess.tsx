        <h1>The Basics</h1>
        
        All laws passed by state legislatures should be informed by feedback from residents and community stakeholders.  In Massachusetts, among other ways to have your voice heard, you can submit written testimony to the legislature regarding specific bills.  
        
        This website, the MATT platform, can help facilitate your submission of written testimony to the MA Legislature.
